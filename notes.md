# project 1

1: either:
- core functionality must be based on randomness
- involve fortune telling

2:
- don't work for more than 2 hours at a time

3: pick up and old project of yours and do one of the following:
- add a new feature to an old project
- take an old feature and put it into a new project

## msgsweet - old makesweet-esque program from 2023 that used cycles to render each frame (ran really slow but it looks cool :3)

original code: see commit `3267eb5583406813da2ef98fca8efb6e088a02f4`

ideas:
- something like unix `fortune` command [#1]
- random images of crystal balls [#1]
- hip support (because i can't render without it since i'm team red now) [#3]

additions:
- HIP support (see commit: `7eaba29242b0673298a42be3ff067dbd0109e2d7`) [fulfills #3, but it feels lazy, i might add some more stuff in]
